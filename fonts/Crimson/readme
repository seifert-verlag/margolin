Hi!

Thanks for downloading Crimson Text. What you have right here is the version from August 2nd, 2011. It contains the Roman ("Regular"), Italic and Bold cuts, because those are the ones that are up to date. They've just been professionally kerned by Igino Marini's wonderful iKern algorithm.

The (older, somewhat ugly, and unkerned) Semibold and Bold Italic cuts are available via SVN. Or just email me.

The files are licensed under the terms of the Open Font License. If you have any questions, concerns, suggestions, or want to help out somehow (!), shoot me an email at sebastian@aldusleaf.org.

Best,
Seb
